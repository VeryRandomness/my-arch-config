# wttr.in format string: 
# %l (location), %c (condition symbol), %t (temperature), %f (temperature feels like), %C (condition text), %w (wind), %h (humidity), %p (percipitation (mm/3 hours)), %P (pressure Hpa), %u (UV index), %m (moon phase symbol), %M (moon day), %s (sunest time (local time)), %S (sunrise time (local time))
# you need a "+" sign for everything after the ":"
# you can also add "|" to divide things
# if you want the tempuratre to be in metric add "&%m" after "%t" NOTE: This will cause other things in your string to not show.
# an example could be "https://wttr.in/?format=%l:+%t+%f+%w+%s+%S" this shows the locations (%l) the temp (%t) feels like (%f) wind (%w) and sunrise/sunset (%s/%S respectively)
# I would recommend just using this that just tell you the location (Handy with a laptop) and the temperature. If you don't want the location. simply remove the "%l" and replace it with "Temperature" or leave it blank.
